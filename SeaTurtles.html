<h1>Sea Turtles Stranding’s in Florida Over Time</h1>
<p>Sea Turtles can be found all over Florida’s coast because many of them often nest and lay their eggs in the sandy beaches.  However, over the years an increase in turtles have been found stranded on the beaches and not for nesting purposes.  Florida is home to many types of Sea Turtles including the Loggerhead and Green Turtle, Leatherback, Kemp's Ridley, and Hawksbill. These turtles get stranded when they have been washed ashore due to cold waters enabling their ability to swim resulting in them being helpless against currents.  Over the years Florida has seen an increase in stranded turtles on many of their beaches, increasing people’s ability to find to them either, dead, injured, or alive. </p>   
<p>On each of these maps, displays where Sea Turtles can be regularly found in Florida due to nesting, this is shown by the blue lines along the coast.  Also, each of the maps displays the exact location where a Stranded Turtle was found by the Florida Fish and Wildlife Conservation Commission (FWC) and this is shown by the turtle icon on the maps. The general trend that keeps occurring is that more and more turtles found on the beaches are stranded and not there to lay their eggs </p>
